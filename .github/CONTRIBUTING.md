## Design Essence

The modern web designer faces no limitations in his approach to design and will
often choose the wrong combination. Without limits, a designer may be overwhelmed
by the array of components at his disposal. Houdini, polyfills, and other similar
technologies are all attempts to bypass the limitations of CSS and JavaScript.
However, without the fundamental principles of design, their use becomes
arbitrary. The developer is trained to dominate his technology while the designer
is forced to work within its limits. By limiting or restricting the choices, the
designer is forced to choose the essential and because he has not been trained as
a developer, he can use his limitation with technology to discover new designs.

## Design Principles

In the late 1970s, Dieter Rams grew increasingly concerned by the state of the world
around him, which he described as an impenetrable confusion of forms, colors, and
noises. Aware that he was a significant contributor to that world, he asked himself
an important question: is my design; good design? His answer is expressed in his ten
principles for good design.

### Ten Principles for Good Design

1. **Good design is innovative**  
    The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted.
    Technological development is always offering new opportunities for
    innovative design. But innovative design always develops in tandem
    with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.

2. **Good design makes a product useful**  
    A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not
    only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design
    emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything
    that could possibly detract from it.

3. **Good design is aesthetic**  
    The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness
    because products we use every day affect our person and our
    well-being. But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.

4. **Good design makes a product understandable**  
    It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the prod-
    uct talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.

5. **Good design is unobtrusive**  
    Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative
    objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both
    neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user’s self-expression.

6. **Good design is honest**  
    It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable
    than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with
    promises that cannot be kept.

7. **Good design is long-lasting**  
    It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated.
    Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years – even in today’s
    throwaway society.

8. **Good design is thorough down to the last detail**  
    Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in
    the design process show respect towards the user.

9. **Good design is environmentally-friendly**  
    Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the
    environment. It conserves resources and minimizes physical and
    visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.

10. **Good design is as little design as possible**  
    Less, but better – because it concentrates on the essential aspects,
    and the products are not burdened with non-essentials.
    Back to purity, back to simplicity.

## Design Requirements

Dieter Rams is known for his minimalist and functional design philosophy, which
emphasizes simplicity, usability, and clarity. A UI for the web would likely
incorporate these principles in the following ways:

* Must be easy to install to get started.
* Must be unobtrusive to leave room for the designer's self-expression.
* Must be easy to update, maintain, modify, adapt, customize, and change with minimum effort.
* Must follow the [80/20 principle](https://jacobxperez.github.io/blog/post/heuristic/the-80-20-principle/),
which indicates that 80 percent of the effects come from 20 percent of the causes.
* Identify areas of volatility and encapsulate their effects.
* Identify the minimum amount of components that can satisfy most designs.
* The design would have a minimalist layout with a focus on simplicity and
clarity. The layout would be clean, uncluttered, and easy to navigate.
* The color palette would be limited to a few colors, with a focus on neutral
colors such as white, gray, and black. This would help to create a sense of
simplicity and elegance.
* Typography would be a key element of the design, with a focus on legibility
and readability. Sans-serif fonts would be used, with a limited number of font
weights and sizes.
* The UI would incorporate functional elements such as buttons, forms, and menus
in a way that is intuitive and easy to use. These elements would be designed to
be visually unobtrusive, with a focus on their functionality rather than their
visual appearance.
* The design would be consistent across all pages and elements of the website,
creating a cohesive and unified user experience. This would be achieved through
the use of consistent typography, layout, and color scheme.
* The overall design would be focused on the user experience, with an emphasis
on making the website easy and enjoyable to use. This would be achieved through
the use of intuitive navigation, clear calls-to-action, and a focus on user needs.

## Bug Reports

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment?
What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS experience the problem?
What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help us fix any
potential bugs.

## Feature Requests

Before opening a feature request, please take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to convince the project's
developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context
as possible.

## Pull Requests

Ask first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features,
refactoring code, porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of
time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the
project. When contributing code to this project ask yourself these questions.

* Is it essential?
* Will it add value?
* Is this change necessary?

## Acknowledgment

I want to dedicate this project to all developers, architects, and designers who
have fiddled with the limitations of CSS. I know your pain, your struggles, and
your frustrations. May we all find peace and tranquility in our hearts and mind.
