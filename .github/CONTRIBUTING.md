## Design Essence

The modern web designer faces no limitations in his approach to design and will
often choose the wrong combination. Without limits, a designer may be overwhelmed
by the array of components at his disposal. Houdini, polyfills, and other similar
technologies are all attempts to bypass the limitations of CSS and JavaScript.
However, without the fundamental principles of design, their use becomes
arbitrary. The developer is trained to dominate his technology while the designer
is forced to work within its limits. By limiting or restricting the choices, the
designer is forced to choose the essential and because he has not been trained as
a developer, he can use his limitation with technology to discover new designs.

## Design Principles

In the late 1970s, Dieter Rams grew increasingly concerned by the state of the world
around him, which he described as an impenetrable confusion of forms, colors, and
noises. Aware that he was a significant contributor to that world, he asked himself
an important question: is my design; good design? His answer is expressed in his ten
principles for good design.

### Ten Principles for Good Design

#### 1. Good design is innovative

The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted.
Technological development is always offering new opportunities for
innovative design. But innovative design always develops in tandem
with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.

#### 2. Good design makes a product useful

A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not
only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design
emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything
that could possibly detract from it.

#### 3. Good design is aesthetic

The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness
because products we use every day affect our person and our
well-being. But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.

#### 4. Good design makes a product understandable

It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the prod-
uct talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.

#### 5. Good design is unobtrusive

Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative
objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both
neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user’s self-expression.

#### 6. Good design is honest

It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable
than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer with
promises that cannot be kept.

#### 7. Good design is long-lasting

It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated.
Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years – even in today’s
throwaway society.

#### 8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail

Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in
the design process show respect towards the user.

#### 9. Good design is environmentally-friendly

Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the
environment. It conserves resources and minimizes physical and
visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.

#### 10. Good design is as little design as possible

Less, but better – because it concentrates on the essential aspects,
and the products are not burdened with non-essentials.
Back to purity, back to simplicity.

## Design Requirements

* Identify areas of volatility and encapsulate their effects
* Identify the minimum amount of components that can satisfy most designs.
* Must be unobtrusive to leave room for the designer's self-expression.
* Must be easy to update, maintain, modify, adapt, customize, and change with minimum effort.
* Must follow the [80/20 principle](https://jacobxperez.github.io/blog/post/heuristic/the-80-20-principle/),
which indicates that 80 percent of the effects come from 20 percent of the causes.

## Bug Reports

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment?
What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS experience the problem?
What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help us fix any
potential bugs.

## Feature Requests

Before opening a feature request, please take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to convince the project's
developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context
as possible.

## Pull Requests

Ask first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features,
refactoring code, porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of
time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the
project. When contributing code to this project ask yourself these questions.

* Is it essential?
* Will it add value?
* Is this change necessary?

## Acknowledgment

I want to dedicate this project to all developers, architects, and designers who
have fiddled with the limitations of CSS. I know your pain, your struggles, and
your frustrations. May we all find peace and tranquility in our hearts and mind.
