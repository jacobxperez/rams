## Design Essence

The modern web designer faces a few limitations in his approach to design and
will often choose the wrong combination. Without limits, a designer may be
overwhelmed by the array of components at his disposal. Houdini, polyfills,
and other similar technologies are all attempts to bypass the limitations of
CSS and JavaScript. However, without the fundamental principles of design,
their use becomes arbitrary. The developer is trained to dominate his
technology while the designer is forced to work within its limits. By limiting
or restricting the choices, the designer is forced to choose the essential and
because he has not been trained as a developer, he can use his limitation with
technology to discover new designs.

## Design Philosophy

In the book, The Power of Less, [Leo Babauta](https://leobabauta.com/) explains
how to improve performance by starting with small proactive actions, setting
clear limits, identifying the essentials, simplifying your work, eliminating the
unnecessary, and staying focused on the vision.

1. Start small
2. Set clear limits
3. Identify the essential
4. Simplify
5. Eliminate the nonessential
6. Stay focused

## Design Principles

Back in the late 1970s, Dieter Rams was becoming increasingly concerned by the
state of the world around him: “An impenetrable confusion of forms, colors and
noises.” Aware that he was a significant contributor to that world, he asked
himself an important question: is my design good design? His answer is
expressed in his ten principles for good design.

### Ten Principles for Good Design

1. Good design is innovative
2. Good design makes a product useful
3. Good design is aesthetic
4. Good design makes a product understandable
5. Good design is unobtrusive
6. Good design is honest
7. Good design is long-lasting
8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail
9. Good design is environmentally-friendly
10. Good design is as little design as possible

> Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there
> is nothing left to take away.

## Design Requirements

* Identify areas of volatility and encapsulate their effects
* Identify the minimum amount of components that can satisfy most designs.
* Must be unobtrusive to prevent the designer from fighting the framework.
* Must be easy to update, maintain, modify, adapt, customize, and change with minimum effort.
* Must follow the [80/20 principle](https://jacobxperez.github.io/blog/post/heuristic/the-80-20-principle/),
which indicates that 80 percent of the effects come from 20 percent of the causes.

## Bug Reports

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment?
What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS experience the problem?
What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help us fix any
potential bugs.

## Feature Requests

Before opening a feature request, please take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to convince the project's
developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context
as possible.

## Pull Requests

Ask first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features,
refactoring code, porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of
time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the
project. When contributing code to this project ask yourself these questions.

* Is it essential?
* Will it add value?
* Is this change necessary?

## Acknowledgment 

I want to dedicate this project to all developers, architects, and designers who
have fiddled with the limitations of CSS. I know your pain, your struggles, and
your frustrations. May we all find peace and tranquility in our hearts and mind.
