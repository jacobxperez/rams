## Design Essence

The modern web designer faces no limitations in his approach to design and will
often choose the wrong combination. Not knowing what is important and what is
not, a designer may be overwhelmed by the array of components at his disposal.
Polyfills, Houdini, and other similar technologies are all attempts to bypass
the limitations of JavaScript and CSS. However, without the fundamental principles
of design, their use becomes arbitrary. The developer; is trained to dominate his
technology, while the designer; is forced to work within his limitations. By limiting
or restricting the choices, the designer; is forced to prioritize the essentials,
and because he has not; been trained as a developer, he uses his limitation with
technology to discover new designs.

## Design Principles

In the late 1970s, Dieter Rams grew increasingly concerned by the state of the world
around him, which he described as an impenetrable confusion of forms, colors, and
noises. Aware that he was a significant contributor to that world, he asked himself
an important question: is my design; good design? His answer is expressed in his ten
principles for good design.

### Ten Principles for Good Design

<details>

<summary>1. Good design is innovative</summary>

The possibilities for innovation are not, by any means, exhausted.
Technological development is always offering new opportunities for
innovative design. But innovative design always develops in tandem
with innovative technology, and can never be an end in itself.

</details>

<details>

<summary>2. Good design makes a product useful</summary>

A product is bought to be used. It has to satisfy certain criteria, not
only functional, but also psychological and aesthetic. Good design
emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything
that could possibly detract from it.

</details>

<details>

<summary>3. Good design is aesthetic</summary>

The aesthetic quality of a product is integral to its usefulness
because products we use every day affect our person and our
well-being. But only well-executed objects can be beautiful.

</details>

<details>

<summary>4. Good design makes a product understandable</summary>

It clarifies the product’s structure. Better still, it can make the product
talk. At best, it is self-explanatory.

</details>

<details>

<summary>5. Good design is unobtrusive</summary>

Products fulfilling a purpose are like tools. They are neither decorative
objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both
neutral and restrained, to leave room for the user’s self-expression.

</details>

<details>

<summary>6. Good design is honest</summary>

It does not make a product more innovative, powerful or valuable
than it really is. It does not attempt to manipulate the consumer
with promises that cannot be kept.

</details>

<details>

<summary>7. Good design is long-lasting</summary>

It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated.
Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years – even in today’s
throwaway society.

</details>

<details>

<summary>8. Good design is thorough down to the last detail</summary>

Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in
the design process show respect towards the user.

</details>

<details>

<summary>9. Good design is environmentally-friendly</summary>

Design makes an important contribution to the preservation of the
environment. It conserves resources and minimizes physical and
visual pollution throughout the lifecycle of the product.

</details>

<details>

<summary>10. Good design is as little design as possible</summary>

Less, but better – because it concentrates on the essential aspects,
and the products are not burdened with non-essentials. Back to purity,
back to simplicity.

</details>

## Design Requirements

Dieter Rams is known for his minimalist and functional design philosophy, which
emphasizes simplicity, usability, and clarity. UI components would likely
incorporate these principles in the following ways:

* Identify areas of volatility and encapsulate their effects.
* Identify the minimum amount of components that can satisfy most designs.
* Must be unobtrusive to leave room for the designer's self-expression.
* Must be easy to update, maintain, modify, adapt, customize, and change with minimum effort.
* Must follow the [80/20 principle](https://jacobxperez.github.io/blog/post/heuristic/the-80-20-principle/),
which indicates that 80 percent of the effects come from 20 percent of the causes.
* The layout must be clean, uncluttered, and easy to navigate.
* The design must be consistent across all pages and elements creating a
cohesive and unified user experience.
* The color palette must be limited to few colors such as white, gray, and black.
This will create a sense of simplicity and elegance.
* Typography will be a key element of the design, focused on legibility
and readability, with a limited number of font weights and sizes.
* Components must be designed to be visually unobtrusive, with a focus
on their functionality rather than their visual appearance.

## Updating The Documentation

To update the documentation, install all dependencies on your machine and run the
command `npm run docs`. You can find the source files for the documentation under the
"[src/docs](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams/tree/master/src/docs)" folder. After
updating the documentation, run `npm run rams` to update the root folder
[docs](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams/tree/master/docs). This will automatically
update the [website](https://jacobxperez.github.io/rams/) on a pull request.

Run the documentation locally:

```bash
npm run docs
```

Updating the website documentation:

```bash
npm run rams
```

## Pull Requests

[discussion](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams/discussions). Otherwise, you
may end up spending a lot of time working on something that we might not want
to merge into the project. Any contribution to this project will be subject to
