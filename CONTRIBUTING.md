## Design Essence

The modern web designer faces few limitations on his approach to design and
will often choose the wrong combination. Without limits, a designer may be
overwhelmed by the array of components at his disposal. Houdini, polyfill,
and other similar technologies are all attempts to bypass the limitations of
CSS and JavaScript however, without the fundamental knowledge of design,
their use becomes arbitrary. The developer is trained to dominate his
technology while the designer is forced to work within the limitation of it.
By limiting or restricting the choices, the designer is forced to choose the
essential and because he has not been trained as a developer he uses the
limitations to discover new designs.

## Design Philosophy

Perhaps the most famous quote from Dieter Rams "**Good design is as little design
as possible**" meaning that by removing the unnecessary the essential comes to the
forefront. The product becomes useful, understandable, easy to use, and long-lasting.

## Design Principles

In the book, The Power of Less, [Leo Babauta](https://leobabauta.com/) explains how to
streamline your life by identifying the essential and eliminating the unnecessary.
By focusing on the essentials and allowing everything else to fade away, you can
become less stressed and more productive.

1. Identify the essential
2. Eliminate the rest

These two principles of identifying the essential and eliminating the rest form
the foundation of this project.

> Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
> â€” Antoine de Saint-Exupery

## Design Requirements

* Identify the minimum amount of components that can satisfy most designs.
* Must be unobtrusive to prevent the designer from fighting the framework.
* Must be easy to update, maintain, modify, adapt, customize, and change with minimum effort.
* Must follow the [80/20 principle](https://jacobxperez.github.io/blog/post/heuristic/the-80-20-principle/),
which indicates that 80 percent of the effects come from 20 percent of the variables.

## Bug Reports

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment?
What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS experience the problem?
What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help us fix any
potential bugs.

## Feature Requests

Before opening a feature request, please take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to convince the project's
developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context
as possible.

## Pull Requests

Ask first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features,
refactoring code, porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of
time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the
project. When contributing code to this project ask yourself these questions.

* Is it essential?
* Will it add value?
* Is this change necessary?

## Acknowledgment 

I want to dedicate this project to all developers, architects, and designers who
have fiddled with the limitations of CSS. I know your pain, your struggles, and
your frustrations. May we all find peace and tranquility in our hearts and mind.
