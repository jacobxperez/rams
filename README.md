## About

Unlike other monolith frameworks, [RAMs](https://jacobxperez.github.io/rams/)
provides a minimum set of components that gives the designer the freedom to explore and discover
new designs. By removing the unnecessary, the essential simplifies the design process.

## Getting Started

Start by **[downloading](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams/archive/master.zip)** the
[repository](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams) or by cloning the project:

    git clone https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams.git

### Default Build

The easiest way to include [RAMs](https://jacobxperez.github.io/rams/) in your
projects is by copying the pre-compiled [CSS](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams/blob/master/css/main.css)
file into your project folder and then linking to it in HTML.

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css">

* [/css](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams/tree/master/css/less)
    * [main.css](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams/blob/master/css/main.css)

### Custom Build

Add custom [modules](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams/tree/master/css/modules), edit the
[variables.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams/blob/master/css/themes/variables.less),
uncomment unused components from [main.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams/blob/master/css/themes/main/main.less) then
compile to produce the final [CSS](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams/blob/master/css/main.css).
Check out [Editors and Plugins](http://lesscss.org/tools/#editors-and-plugins)
for compiling [LESS](http://lesscss.org/).
