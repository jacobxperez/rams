## About

Unlike other monolith frameworks, [Essentials](https://jacobxperez.github.io/essentials/)
provides a minimum set of components that gives the designer the freedom to explore and discover
new designs. By removing the unnecessary, the essential simplifies the design process.

## Getting Started

Start by **[downloading](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/archive/master.zip)** the [repository](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials) or by cloning the project:

    git clone https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials.git

### Default Build

The easiest way to include [Essentials](https://jacobxperez.github.io/essentials/) in your
projects is by copying the pre-compiled [CSS](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/main.css)
file into your project folder and then linking to it in HTML.

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css">

* [/css](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less)
    * [main.css](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/main.css)

### Custom Build

Essentials is capable of handling and maintaining multiple [themes](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/themes)
utilizing the same source code. Just as in art school, the designer can quickly generate several designs to test before choosing the best option.
Check out [Editors and Plugins](http://lesscss.org/tools/#editors-and-plugins) for compiling [LESS](http://lesscss.org/).
