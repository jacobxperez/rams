## Design Principles

Leo Babauta demonstrates in he's book The Power of Less how to streamline your life by identifying the essential and eliminating the unnecessary. By focusing on the essential and allowing everything else to drop away you will become less stressed and more productive.

1. Identify the essential
2. Eliminate the rest

> Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
> Antoine de Saint-Exupery

## Design Influence

### The Bauhaus

The Bauhaus was a school whose approach to design and the combination of fine arts
and crafts proved to be a major influence on the development of graphic design as
well as much of 20th century modern art. Founded in 1919 by Walter Gropius in
Weimarm Germany, the school favored simplified forms, rationality, functionality
and the idea of mass production could live in harmony with the artistic spirit
of individuality.

### International Typographic Style

The International Typographic Style, also known as the Swiss Style, is a graphic
design style developed in Switzerland in the 1950s that emphasizes cleanliness,
readability and objectivity. Hallmarks of the style are asymmetric layouts, use
of a grid, sans-serif typefaces and flush left, ragged right text. The style has
a preference for photography. Many of the early International Typographic Style
works featured typography as a primary design element and it is for this that
the style is named.

### The New Typography

In the 1920s and 1930s, the so-called New Typography movement brought graphics and
information design to the forefront of the artistic avant-garde in Central Europe.
Rejecting traditional arrangement of type in symmetrical columns, modernist designers
organized the printed page or poster as a blank field in which blocks of type and
illustration (frequently photomontage) could be arranged in harmonious, strikingly
asymmetrical compositions.

### De Stijl

De Stijl Dutch for "The Style", also known as neoplasticism, was a Dutch artistic
movement founded in 1917. Proponents of De Stijl advocated pure abstraction and
universality by a reduction to the essentials of form and colour; they simplified
visual compositions to the vertical and horizontal directions, and used only primary
colors along with black and white.

### Ludwig Mies van der Rohe

Regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of architecture, Ludwig
Mies van der Rohe’s "**less is more**" approach to design was the gold standard for many
generations of modern architecture.

### Josef Müller-Brockmann

Josef Müller-Brockmann was a Swiss graphic designer and teacher. He studied
architecture, design and history of art at both the University and Kunstgewerbeschule
in Zurich. He is recognised for his simple designs and his clean use of typography,
notably Akzidenz-Grotesk, shapes and colours which inspires many graphic designers
in the 21st century.

### Emil Ruder

Ruder published a basic grammar of typography titled "**Emil Ruder: Typography**". The book
helped spread and propagate the **Swiss Style**, and became a basic text for graphic design
and typography programs in Europe and North America.

### Kenya Hara

Kenya Hara is a prominent graphic designer in Japan. He is currently the art director of
MUJI, a professor at Musashino Art University, and also the representative director of
the Nippon Design Center (NDC) Inc. He is interested in designing circumstances or
conditions rather than things. He traveled the world widely in an attempt to investigate
the meaning of **design**.

### Dieter Rams

As head of design at Braun, the German consumer electronics manufacturer, Dieter Rams emerged
as one of the most influential industrial designers of the late 20th century by defining an
elegant, legible, yet rigorous visual language for its products.

#### Ten Principles of Good Design

Rams introduced the idea of sustainable development and of obsolescence being a crime in
design in the 1970s. He asked himself the question: is my design **good design**? The answer
formed is now the celebrated *ten principles of good design*.

1. Is innovative
2. Makes a product useful
3. Is aesthetic
4. Makes a product understandable
5. Is unobtrusive
6. Is honest
7. Is long lasting
8. Is thorough down to the last detail
9. Is environmentally friendly
10. Is as little design as possible
