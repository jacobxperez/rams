## About

[RAMs](https://jacobxperez.github.io/rams/) is a modern CSS framework with
Zero-Class Architecture that utilizes the power of
[data-attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes)
for styling components. By removing class names from CSS, your HTML becomes
less cluttered easy to read, and more scalable.

### Features

* [Zero-Class Architecture](https://jacobxperez.github.io/blog/post/css/zero-class/architecture/)
* Powered by data-attributes
* Dark mode enabled
* Built with [less](http://lesscss.org/), but better

## Getting Started

Start by **[downloading](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams/archive/master.zip)** the
[repository](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams) or by cloning the project

    git clone https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams.git

### Default Build

The easiest way to start using [RAMs](https://jacobxperez.github.io/rams/) is by
copying the pre-compiled [CSS](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams/blob/master/css/main.css)
file into your project folder and then linking to it in HTML.

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main.css">

* [/css](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams/tree/master/css/less)
    * [main.css](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams/blob/master/css/main.css)

### Custom Build

Edit the [settings.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams/blob/master/css/themes/main/settings.less),
add custom [modules](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams/tree/master/css/modules),
then compile [main.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams/blob/master/css/themes/main/main.less)
to produce the final [CSS](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams/blob/master/css/main.css).
Check out [Editors and Plugins](http://lesscss.org/tools/#editors-and-plugins)
for compiling [LESS](http://lesscss.org/).

* [settings.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams/blob/master/css/themes/main/settings.less)
(variables for font, colors, and more)
* [modules](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams/tree/master/css/modules)
(add custom modules here)
* [main.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams/blob/master/css/themes/main/main.less)
(compile to produce the final [CSS](https://github.com/jacobxperez/rams/blob/master/css/main.css))
