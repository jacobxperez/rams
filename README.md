## About

[Essentials](https://jacobxperez.github.io/essentials/) is a front-end composable design system build with [LESS](http://lesscss.org/).

### Project Status

Project under active development. **NO** stable version has been released.

## Getting Started

Start by **[downloading](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/archive/master.zip)** the [repository](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials) or by cloning the project:

    $ git clone https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials.git

### Default Build

The easiest way to include [Essentials](https://jacobxperez.github.io/essentials/) in your projects is by copying the pre-compiled [CSS](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/style.css) file into your project folder and then link to it in HTML.

* [/css](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css)
    * [style.css](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/style.css)

### Custom Build

Adjust the [variables](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/variables.less) and if needed add [custom](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/custom.less) code then compile everything with [style.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/style.less) to produce the final [CSS](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/style.css).

* [/css](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css)
    * [variables.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/variables.less) (adjust the settings)
    * [custom.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/custom.less) (write custom modules)
    * [style.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/style.less) (compile everything together)

### Bug Reports

Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help us fix any potential bugs.

### Feature Requests

Before opening a feature request, please take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

### Pull Requests

Please ask first before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project. When contributing code to this project always ask yourself these questions.

* Is it essential?
* Will it add value?
* Is this change necessary?

## Design Principles

Leo Babauta demonstrates in his book The Power of Less how to streamline your life by identifying the essential and eliminating the unnecessary. By focusing on the essential and allowing everything else to drop away you will become less stressed and more productive.

1. Identify the essential
2. Eliminate the rest

> Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
