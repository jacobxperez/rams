## About

Unlike other monolith frameworks, [Essentials](https://jacobxperez.github.io/essentials/)
provides a minimum set of components which gives the designer the freedom to explore and
discover new designs. By removing the unnecessary the essential comes to the light, thus
leaving room for the designer self-expression.

## Getting Started

Start by **[downloading](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/archive/master.zip)** the [repository](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials) or by cloning the project:

    git clone https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials.git

### Default Build

The easiest way to include [Essentials](https://jacobxperez.github.io/essentials/)
in your projects is by copying the pre-compiled
[CSS](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/style.css)
file into your project folder and then link to it in HTML.

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">

* [/css](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less)
    * [style.css](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/style.css)

### Custom Build

Adjust the [variables](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/less/variables.less) and if needed, add [custom](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/less/custom.less) [modules](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less/modules) then compile everything together in [style.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/less/style.less) to produce the final [CSS](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/style.css). Optional, comment out unwanted components from [style.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/less/style.less) then compile your project. Check out [Editors and Plugins](http://lesscss.org/tools/#editors-and-plugins) for compiling [LESS](http://lesscss.org/).
