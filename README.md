## About

Unlike other monolith frameworks, [Essentials](https://jacobxperez.github.io/essentials/)
provides a minimum set of components that by combining them together allows for
the creation of unique individual designs. By removing the unnecessary the essential
comes to the light, thus leaving room for the designer self-expression.

## Getting Started

Start by **[downloading](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/archive/master.zip)** the [repository](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials) or by cloning the project:

    git clone https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials.git

### Default Build

The easiest way to include [Essentials](https://jacobxperez.github.io/essentials/)
in your projects is by copying the pre-compiled
[CSS](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/style.css)
file into your project folder and then link to it in HTML.

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">

* [/css](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/tree/master/css/less)
    * [style.css](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/style.css)

### Custom Build

Adjust the [variables](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/less/variables.less) and if needed, add [custom](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/less/custom.less) modules then compile everything together in [style.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/less/style.less) to produce the final [CSS](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/style.css). Optional, comment out unwanted components from [style.less](https://github.com/jacobxperez/essentials/blob/master/css/less/style.less) then compile your project. Check out [Editors and Plugins](http://lesscss.org/tools/#editors-and-plugins) for compiling [LESS](http://lesscss.org/).
