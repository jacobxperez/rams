# Themes

[RAMs](https://jacobxperez.github.io/rams/) is capable of handling and maintaining multiple themes
utilizing the same source code. Just as in art school, the designer can quickly generate several designs to test before
choosing the best option. Check out [Editors and Plugins](http://lesscss.org/tools/#editors-and-plugins) for
compiling [LESS](http://lesscss.org/).
